# Markov-Transitions-Infectious-Diseases-GI-Cancer

Code for Markov chain modeling of infectious disease transitions to gastrointestinal cancers. Constructs transition networks for 47 infections and 5 cancers, with centrality analysis to identify key infection hubs and bridges. Also includes biomarker analysis for early cancer risk indicators.

## Code Description

- **Python Code**: Handles data preprocessing, including cleaning and preparing the input datasets for subsequent analysis.
- **R Code**: Includes the construction of the infectious diseases to GI cancer Markov chain, centrality analysis to identify key transition patterns, and biomarker analysis for distinguishing early cancer risk indicators.
