# Markov-Transitions-Infectious-Diseases-GI-Cancer

Code for Markov chain modeling of infectious disease transitions to gastrointestinal cancers. Constructs transition networks for 47 infections and 5 cancers, with centrality analysis to identify key infection hubs and bridges. Also includes biomarker analysis for early cancer risk indicators.

For testing purposes only. For data requests, please contact the respective database administrator.

## Code Description

- **Python Code**: Handles data preprocessing, including cleaning and preparing the input datasets for subsequent analysis. "Disease and Corresponding ICD-9 and ICD-10 Codes.txt" is the disease dictionary used in the MarketScan ICD data processing.py. "test data" is the raw data used in MarketScan ICD data processing.py.
  
- **R Code**: Includes the construction of the infectious diseases to GI cancer Markov chain, centrality analysis to identify key transition patterns, and biomarker analysis for distinguishing early cancer risk indicators. "test data" is the data preparation file for constructing a Markov chain in R. "0.05.csv" is the data preparation file for network centrality analysis in R.
